# PCB_styleguide
Styleguide for Remote Labs PCB Production

_To progress projects with a more uniform nature, it is the aim of this document to establish some basic design guidelines for PCB design and fabrication. They are not intended as hard rules, but as a reference of the best practice moving forwards._

## Quick Reference & Checklist
_Make sure all items are included before moving to quoting for fabrication_

- PCB Name & Version Number []
- JLC PCB Serial number designation "JLCJLCJLCJLC"
- Social Links - Practicable.io github []
- Social Links - PCB Designers choice []
- Serial Number, Producion Date & Assembly note block





## Netclasses
_The standard set of netclasses it is expected will be used for most production PCBs, along with some other classes that have been carefully calculated in the past to meet power supply requirements._

| Netclass Name |  Trace Width | Clearance   | Via Size  | Via Hole  |
|---            |---           |---          |---        |---        |
|               |              |             |           |           |


## Labelling & Text

| Text Purpose              | Width | Height | Thickness |
|---|---|---|---
| Component footprint labels| >=0.8| >=0.8 |   |
| PCB Name |
| Github/Social Links |
| JLC Serial Number | 0.15 | 0.8 |  

## Serial Numbering

A white block will be provided on rear silkscreen to write:
- PCB Serial Number
- Population Data
- Builder's Initials

This will allow greater traceability of problems through the production and testing.
